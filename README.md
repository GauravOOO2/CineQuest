# CineQuest ðŸŽ¥

A Complete ReactJS application.

## Made by [J Gaurav Varma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaurav-varm-oo21/)

## Project Description

CineQuest is a website designed to streamline the movie selection process based on user preferences inputted through three text fields: Country, Genre, and Language. Upon submission, the website suggests movies available in the JSON data that match the user's criteria. Utilizing the .map method, I dynamically filtered and rendered the matching movie data on the front end. To enhance user experience, I integrated unaliased MUI for rendering dropdown fields, ensuring a smoother, faster, and lighter system operation. Additionally, I prioritized responsiveness across all screen sizes by implementing custom styling directly in the SX, ensuring adaptability of fields and cards. The overall design aims to provide users with a visually appealing and pleasant browsing experience.
